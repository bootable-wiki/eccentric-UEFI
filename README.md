# eccentric-UEFI
Could be considered "awesome" but it's more appropriate to call it "eccentric"

The license it yet to be determined as this is also a location where I will centralize all sorts mixed license projects & files.

If you need to create a Windows installer on Mac or Linux you should probably use the files from [UEFI_NTFS](https://github.com/bootable-wiki/eccentric-UEFI/tree/main/UEFI_NTFS)
